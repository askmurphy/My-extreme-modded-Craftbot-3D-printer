# My extreme modded Craftbot 3D-printer
After some hardware issues I want to upgrade my nice Craftbot Plus 3D-printer, busy for 2 year (allways too little free time), but now ithe mod is almost done and this old printer is alive again makes nice prints!  Time for sharing..

This is a nice LoRa sensor for measuring the pH and the temperature of your swimming pool, drainage-basin or whatever you like.

| Just a few photo's | will be updated soon! |
